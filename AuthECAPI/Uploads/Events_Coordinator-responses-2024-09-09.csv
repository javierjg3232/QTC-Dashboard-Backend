Last January it took me 10 minutes in and out to complete. This year it took over an hour and half to complete that same exact process. I was told that the event has been averaging close to 2 hours. 

The process doesn’t make sense, when you finally get through the hearing test, you have to check out 2 different times with QTC before you even check out of that station. I sat for ten extra minutes watching some input random things (including my dental info??) that didn’t use a mouse to navigate page to page. 

To conclude, This single event made this the worst overall experience at an SRP/SRC that I’ve witnessed.","No, do not contact me.",
